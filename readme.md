### My dotfiles

Just a collection of files from my Mac folder. Probably only useful to me. I have gathered these items from various places.

+  Bash stuff
+  Rails defaults
+  Git stuff
+  Tmux and other random settings.

#### Notes

+  GitHub is a great place to browse other users dotfiles. You can learn alot.
